; Example of a custom conversion rule for assets.
; By default, we already use AUDIOCONV for .xm and .ym files.
; But here, we additionally want to enable --ym-compress.
; The first argument is the source file, the second the target extension
; (after converting), the third is the command string to execute.
; Note that $TARGET must appear there to reference the target file
; $SOURCE will resolve to the paht of the source file. If no $SOURCE is in the
; command string, then it is automatically appended at the end.
